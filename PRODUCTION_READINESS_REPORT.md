## üöÄ Deployment Guide (Vercel)

### Step 1: Fix ESLint Errors

Run this command to apply automatic fixes:

```bash
# Fix ESLint errors automatically
npm run lint -- --fix

# Then rebuild to verify
npm run build
```

If there are remaining errors, manually fix them (see section below).

### Step 2: Prepare for Vercel

1. **Create Vercel Account**
   - Go to https://vercel.com
   - Sign up with GitHub

2. **Push Code to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - Ready for production"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gymnastics-manager.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Connect to Vercel**
   - Log in to Vercel
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Vercel will auto-detect Next.js

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables in Vercel

Add these environment variables in Vercel Dashboard:

```env
# Database (Use existing Neon DB or create new)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_MCJ0IhkwcnR2@ep-red-sky-agftneyp-pooler.c-2.eu-central-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require

# Auth - IMPORTANT: Generate new secret
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<GENERATE_NEW_SECRET_HERE>
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://YOUR_DOMAIN.vercel.app

# App
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://YOUR_DOMAIN.vercel.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=Gymnastics Training Manager
NEXT_PUBLIC_MIN_CANCELLATION_HOURS=2
NEXT_PUBLIC_MIN_CANCELLATION_REASON_LENGTH=10

# Email
RESEND_API_KEY=re_5pLyiD3m_3uyGJJPW3cn9VceyRRqNWg3j
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

**Generate new NEXTAUTH_SECRET:**
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### Step 4: Configure Email Domain (Resend)

1. Go to https://resend.com/domains
2. Add your custom domain
3. Add DNS records (SPF, DKIM, etc.)
4. Verify domain
5. Update `EMAIL_FROM` to `noreply@yourdomain.com`

### Step 5: Run Database Migrations

After first deployment, run migrations:

```bash
# Option 1: Use Vercel CLI locally
npx vercel env pull .env.production.local
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Option 2: Add build command in Vercel
# Build Command: prisma migrate deploy && next build
```

### Step 6: Seed Initial Data

Create initial trainer account:

```bash
# Run seed script (only once)
npx prisma db seed
```

This creates:
- Trainer: `trainer@gym.com` / `trainer123`
- Admin: `admin@gym.com` / `admin123`
- Test Athlete: `athlete@test.com` / `athlete123`

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** Change these passwords immediately after deployment!

### Step 7: Deploy!

```bash
# Using Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel
vercel --prod

# Or push to GitHub (auto-deploys)
git push origin main
```

### Step 8: Post-Deployment Verification

1. **Test Login**
   - [ ] Trainer login works
   - [ ] Athlete login works
   - [ ] Redirects work correctly

2. **Test Email**
   - [ ] Go to `/trainer/test-email`
   - [ ] Send test emails (all 4 types)
   - [ ] Verify delivery

3. **Test Key Features**
   - [ ] Athlete registration
   - [ ] Trainer approval flow
   - [ ] Session attendance marking
   - [ ] Training plan upload
   - [ ] Mobile responsiveness

4. **Test Permissions**
   - [ ] Athletes can't access trainer routes
   - [ ] Athletes can't edit training config
   - [ ] Only trainers can mark attendance

## üìã Manual ESLint Fixes

If automatic fixes don't work, here are the manual fixes needed:

### 1. Fix `any` Types

Replace these:
```typescript
// Before
} catch (err: any) {

// After  
} catch (err: unknown) {
  const error = err as Error;
```

### 2. Fix Unused Variables

Remove unused imports/variables:
```typescript
// Remove these if unused:
import { Input } from '@/components/ui/input';
import { Calendar } from 'lucide-react';
```

### 3. Fix React Hook Dependencies

Add missing dependencies or disable warning if intentional:
```typescript
// Before
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData();
}, []);

// After - Option 1: Add dependency
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData();
}, [fetchData]);

// After - Option 2: Disable if intentional
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData();
  // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
}, []);
```

### 4. Fix Empty Interfaces

```typescript
// Before
export interface InputProps extends React.InputHTMLAttributes<HTMLInputElement> {}

// After
export type InputProps = React.InputHTMLAttributes<HTMLInputElement>;
```

## üîê Security Recommendations

### Before Going Live:

1. **Change Default Passwords**
   - Update all seeded account passwords
   - Or delete test accounts

2. **Enable HTTPS Only**
   - Vercel provides this automatically
   - Ensure `NEXTAUTH_URL` uses `https://`

3. **Configure CORS** (if needed)
   - Add to `next.config.ts` if external API access needed

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - Consider adding rate limiting to API routes
   - Vercel provides some DDoS protection

5. **Backup Strategy**
   - Neon provides automatic backups
   - Set up manual backup schedule

---

## üìä Performance Expectations

Based on current setup:

- **First Load Time:** < 2 seconds (Vercel Edge Network)
- **Time to Interactive:** < 3 seconds
- **API Response Time:** < 500ms (with Neon DB)
- **Email Delivery:** < 5 seconds (Resend)
