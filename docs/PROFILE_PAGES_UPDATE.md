- Optimized queries with proper indexing consideration

### Type Safety
- All TypeScript interfaces properly defined
- Error handling with type guards
- Proper null checking for optional fields

### Performance Considerations
- Statistics calculated server-side
- Minimal database queries (using aggregations)
- Client-side caching via React state
