   - Visual feedback with names and counts

3. **Trainer Assignment**:
   - Assign trainers to specific groups
   - First selected trainer marked as "Primary"

   - Inline remove buttons with confirmation
   - Real-time count updates
   - Error handling with conflict messages

**API Integration**:
- `GET /api/admin/recurring-trainings/[id]` - Training details
- `GET /api/admin/recurring-trainings/[id]/groups` - List groups
- `POST /api/admin/recurring-trainings/[id]/groups` - Create group
- `DELETE /api/admin/recurring-trainings/[id]/groups/[groupId]` - Delete group
- `POST /api/admin/recurring-trainings/[id]/athletes` - Assign athletes (with `trainingGroupId`)
- `DELETE /api/admin/recurring-trainings/[id]/athletes` - Remove athlete (with `trainingGroupId`)
- `POST /api/admin/recurring-trainings/[id]/trainers` - Assign trainers (with `trainingGroupId`)

## 📊 Estimated Time Remaining

| Category | Pages | Hours | Status |
|----------|-------|-------|--------|
| Admin UI | 2/4 | ~2-4 hours | 🟢 Major work done |
| Trainer UI | 1/5 | ~4-6 hours | � Critical page done |

| **Total** | **3/13** | **~10-16 hours** | **35% complete** |

## 🎨 UI Pattern Established

The completed admin pages establish patterns for:
1. **Modal-based workflows** - Create/edit in overlays
2. **Card-based layouts** - One card per group
3. **Inline actions** - Add/remove with icon buttons
4. **Real-time updates** - Fetch after mutations
5. **Conflict handling** - Show error messages from API
6. **Safety confirmations** - Confirm destructive actions

These patterns should be reused in trainer and athlete UIs for consistency.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Trainer Session View** (Priority 1)
   - Most complex component
   - Most frequently used by trainers
   - Blocks trainer workflow

2. **Athlete Schedule** (Priority 2)
   - Simple updates
   - High visibility for athletes

3. **Trainer Session Planning** (Priority 3)
   - Less frequently used
   - Can build on session view patterns

Would you like me to continue with the trainer session view, or would you prefer to test the admin UI first?
