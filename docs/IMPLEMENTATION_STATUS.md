# Training Structure Restructuring - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED CHANGES

### 1. Database Schema Updates (Prisma Schema)
**File**: `prisma/schema.prisma`

#### New Models Created:
- ‚úÖ **TrainingGroup**: Named groups within recurring trainings
  - Replaces the simple `groupNumber` field with proper named groups
  - Fields: `id`, `recurringTrainingId`, `name`, `description`, `sortOrder`
  
- ‚úÖ **SessionGroup**: Instance of a TrainingGroup for a specific session
  - Contains session-specific data like exercises and notes
  - Fields: `id`, `trainingSessionId`, `trainingGroupId`, `exercises`, `notes`
  
- ‚úÖ **SessionGroupTrainerAssignment**: Trainers assigned to specific session groups
  - Allows per-session trainer overrides
  - `trainerId` is nullable for rare "no trainer" cases
  
- ‚úÖ **SessionAthleteAssignment**: One-time athlete reassignments within a session
  - Enables drag-and-drop functionality
  - Fields: `athleteId`, `sessionGroupId`, `movedBy`, `movedAt`, `reason`

#### Modified Models:
- ‚úÖ **RecurringTraining**: Removed `groupNumber` field
  - Now contains multiple `TrainingGroup` children
  
- ‚úÖ **TrainingSession**: Removed `groupNumber`, `equipment1`, `equipment2` fields
  - Now contains multiple `SessionGroup` children
  - Equipment info preserved in notes during migration
  
- ‚úÖ **RecurringTrainingAthleteAssignment**: Changed from `recurringTrainingId` to `trainingGroupId`
  - Athletes now assigned to specific groups, not just trainings
  
- ‚úÖ **RecurringTrainingTrainerAssignment**: Changed from `recurringTrainingId` to `trainingGroupId`
  - Trainers now assigned to specific groups within trainings
  
- ‚úÖ **Athlete**: Added `sessionAthleteAssignments` relation
  - Added index on `birthDate` for age group calculations
  
- ‚úÖ **Trainer**: Updated relations for new structure
  - Added `sessionGroupAssignments` and `sessionAthleteReassignments`

#### Deprecated Models:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **TrainerSessionAssignment**: Kept for backward compatibility but no longer used
  - Relations removed, exists as standalone legacy table

### 2. Utility Functions Created
**File**: `src/lib/ageGroups.ts`

- ‚úÖ `calculateAgeGroup()`: Auto-calculates age group from birth date
- ‚úÖ `getAgeGroupDefinitions()`: Returns age group definitions for any year
- ‚úÖ `formatAgeGroupDisplay()`: Formats age group with birth years
- ‚úÖ `getAllAgeGroupsWithBirthYears()`: Gets all categories with their years
- ‚úÖ `getAthletesInAgeGroup()`: Filters athletes by age group

Age Groups Supported:
- E-Jugend (2 consecutive birth years)
- D-Jugend (2 consecutive birth years)
- C-Jugend (2 consecutive birth years)
- AB-Jugend (4 consecutive birth years)
- Turnerinnen (all older athletes)

### 3. Migration File Created
**File**: `prisma/migrations/20251022173142_restructure_training_groups_and_sessions/migration.sql`

‚úÖ Migration handles:
1. Creating `TrainingGroup` records from existing `RecurringTraining.groupNumber`
2. Migrating athlete assignments to new structure
3. Migrating trainer assignments to new structure
4. Preserving equipment data in session notes
5. Creating `SessionGroup` records for existing sessions
6. Migrating trainer assignments to session groups
7. Dropping deprecated columns safely

### 4. Documentation Created
- ‚úÖ `MIGRATION_PLAN.md`: Comprehensive migration strategy
- ‚úÖ This implementation summary

### Phase 4: Testing Requirements

#### Backend Tests
- [ ] Create recurring training with multiple groups
- [ ] Assign athletes to groups (validate no conflicts)
- [ ] Assign trainers to groups
- [ ] Generate sessions and verify SessionGroups created
- [ ] Update exercises for a SessionGroup
- [ ] Retrieve previous week's exercises
- [ ] Reassign athlete temporarily (drag-and-drop)
- [ ] Verify athlete returns to default group next week
- [ ] Test age group calculation for all categories
- [ ] Verify validation prevents duplicate group assignments

#### Frontend Tests
- [ ] Create/edit/delete groups in recurring training
- [ ] UI prevents assigning athlete to 2+ groups same session
- [ ] Drag-and-drop athlete between groups
- [ ] Exercises save and load correctly
- [ ] Previous week exercises display correctly
- [ ] Age groups display correctly and update on Jan 1
- [ ] Cancellation reasons visible to trainers

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **Database Backup**: Create a backup before running migration!
2. **Staging Environment**: Test on staging before production
3. **Gradual Rollout**: Consider feature flags for gradual rollout
4. **User Training**: Trainers/admins need guidance on new drag-and-drop features
5. **Monitor Performance**: SessionGroups add complexity; watch query performance

---

## üîÑ ROLLBACK PLAN

If critical issues arise:
1. Keep backup of pre-migration database
2. The old `TrainerSessionAssignment` table still exists (deprecated)
3. Can create feature flag to toggle between old/new logic
4. Most breaking changes are in the API layer, not database constraints

---

## üìû QUESTIONS TO CLARIFY

1. **Group Names**: Should there be predefined group names or fully custom?
2. **Equipment**: Should we keep equipment fields or merge into notes?
3. **Max Groups**: Is there a limit on groups per recurring training?
4. **Exercises Field**: Character limit? Rich text or plain text?
5. **Reassignment Audit**: Should we keep full history of all moves or just current?
6. **Age Group Display**: Where exactly should age groups be shown?

This summary provides a complete overview of what has been done and what remains. The migration is ready to run, and the implementation can proceed in phases as outlined above.
