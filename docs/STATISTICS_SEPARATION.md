## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Date Ranges

```typescript
// Current Year
const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();
const yearStart = new Date(currentYear, 0, 1);
const yearEnd = new Date(currentYear, 11, 31, 23, 59, 59);

// Current Week (Monday-Sunday)
const weekStart = new Date(now);
weekStart.setDate(now.getDate() - now.getDay() + 1);
weekStart.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);

const weekEnd = new Date(weekStart);
weekEnd.setDate(weekStart.getDate() + 6);
weekEnd.setHours(23, 59, 59, 999);

// Current Month
const monthStart = new Date(now.getFullYear(), now.getMonth(), 1);
const monthEnd = new Date(now.getFullYear(), now.getMonth() + 1, 0, 23, 59, 59);
```

### Attendance Rate Calculation

```typescript
const attendanceRate = totalSessions > 0 
  ? Math.round((sessionsAttended / totalSessions) * 100)
  : 0;
```

### Top Athletes Query

```typescript
// Filter athletes with minimum 5 sessions
const topAthletes = athletesWithAttendance
  .filter((a) => a.totalSessions >= 5)
  .sort((a, b) => b.attendanceRate - a.attendanceRate)
  .slice(0, 10);
