# üéâ Trainer Session View - COMPLETED

## Summary

The trainer session view page has been completely rewritten and is now fully functional with the new named groups system. This is the **most critical and complex page** in the entire application, as it's the primary daily interface for all trainers.

## What Was Built

### Frontend: `/src/app/trainer/sessions/[date]/page.tsx`
A comprehensive 700+ line React component that handles:

1. **Group-Based Session Management**
   - Sessions organized by groups (not flat athlete list)
   - Each group shows: name, description, trainers, athletes
   - Multiple groups per training session
   - Responsive grid layout (1-3 columns)

2. **Exercises & Notes**
   - Textarea for exercises per SessionGroup
   - Input field for notes per SessionGroup
   - "Show Previous Week" button to load exercises from 7 days ago
   - Auto-maps previous exercises by training group ID

3. **Drag-and-Drop Athlete Reassignment**
   - HTML5 drag-and-drop between groups
   - Confirmation modal with reason field
   - Visual feedback (grip icon, blue highlight for temp assignments)
   - Audit trail with movedBy, movedAt, reason

4. **Attendance Marking**
   - Three-button interface per athlete: Present / Excused / Unexcused
   - "Mark All Present" button per group
   - Visual feedback for selected status
   - Batch save for all attendance records

5. **Visual Indicators**
   - Temporarily reassigned athletes: Blue background + arrow icon
   - Cancelled athletes: Grayed out with "(Abgesagt)" label
   - Cancelled sessions: Red border + cancellation reason
   - Birth year displayed for each athlete
   - Trainer names shown at group level

### Backend: 3 New API Endpoints

#### 1. `GET /api/trainer/sessions/previous-exercises`
- Fetches exercises from previous week (7 days ago)
- Returns array of session groups with exercises and notes
- Frontend maps by trainingGroupId to populate current session

#### 2. `POST /api/trainer/sessions/[date]/reassign`
- Temporarily reassigns athlete to different group
- Creates or updates SessionAthleteAssignment record
- Stores reason, movedBy (trainer), movedAt (timestamp)
- Handles unique constraint (one reassignment per athlete per session)

#### 3. `PUT /api/trainer/sessions/[date]/attendance`
- Saves attendance records for all athletes in a session
- Creates new AttendanceRecord or updates existing
- Tracks markedBy, lastModifiedBy, lastModifiedAt
- Processes all records in parallel

## Key Features Implemented

‚úÖ **Group-Centric Design**: Changed from flat list to nested groups  
‚úÖ **Exercises Per Group**: Textarea for each SessionGroup  
‚úÖ **Previous Week Lookup**: One-click button to load last week's exercises  
‚úÖ **Drag-and-Drop**: Move athletes between groups with visual feedback

## Technical Highlights

### State Management
```typescript
- groupExercises: { [sessionGroupId]: string }
- groupNotes: { [sessionGroupId]: string }
- attendance: { [sessionId]: { [athleteId]: status } }
- draggedAthlete: { athlete, fromGroupId }
- reassignmentModal: { isOpen, athlete, fromGroupId, toGroupId, reason }
```

### Drag-and-Drop Flow
1. User drags athlete (onDragStart stores athlete + fromGroupId)
2. User drops on target group (onDrop triggers)
3. Confirmation modal opens with both group names
4. User enters optional reason and confirms
5. POST to reassign endpoint
6. Success message + data refresh
7. Athlete appears in new group with "Tempor√§r verschoben" badge

### Previous Week Exercises Flow
1. User clicks "Letzte Woche" button
2. Calculate date 7 days ago
3. GET `/api/trainer/sessions/previous-exercises?date=2024-10-15`
4. API returns all session groups from that date
5. Frontend maps by trainingGroupId
6. Populates exercises in matching groups
7. Success message shown

## Impact

This page enables trainers to:
- üìù Enter exercises for each group (visible to athletes)
- üîÑ Copy exercises from previous week (saves time)
- üë• Reassign athletes between groups when needed (flexibility)
- ‚úÖ Mark attendance for all athletes (required data)
- üìä See all relevant info in one place (trainers, cancellations, notes)

## Files Modified/Created

### Created:
- `/src/app/trainer/sessions/[date]/page.tsx` (700+ lines, complete rewrite)
- `/src/app/api/trainer/sessions/previous-exercises/route.ts` (updated to GET)
- `/src/app/api/trainer/sessions/[date]/reassign/route.ts` (new)
- `/src/app/api/trainer/sessions/[date]/attendance/route.ts` (new)

### Database Models Used:
- `TrainingSession` (with groups relation)
- `SessionGroup` (exercises, notes fields)
- `SessionAthleteAssignment` (for drag-and-drop reassignments)
- `AttendanceRecord` (for marking attendance)
- `Cancellation` (for displaying cancellations)

## Testing Checklist

To fully test this page, you should:

1. **View Session**:
   - [ ] Navigate to a session date with multiple groups
   - [ ] Verify all groups display with names and descriptions
   - [ ] Check that athletes are organized by group
   - [ ] Confirm trainer names show per group

2. **Exercises**:
   - [ ] Enter exercises in textarea for a group
   - [ ] Click "Letzte Woche" button
   - [ ] Verify previous week's exercises populate (if they exist)
   - [ ] Save and verify exercises persist

3. **Drag-and-Drop**:
   - [ ] Drag an athlete from one group to another
   - [ ] Verify confirmation modal opens
   - [ ] Enter a reason (optional)
   - [ ] Confirm and check athlete moves
   - [ ] Verify "Tempor√§r verschoben" badge appears
   - [ ] Check reason displays below athlete name

4. **Attendance**:

   - [ ] Mark another as Absent (Excused)
   - [ ] Mark another as Absent (Unexcused)
   - [ ] Use "Alle" button to mark all present in a group
   - [ ] Save and verify attendance persists

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - [ ] Test with cancelled session (should disable inputs)
   - [ ] Test with athletes who cancelled (should gray out)
   - [ ] Test with empty group (should show "Keine Athleten")
   - [ ] Test with no previous week data (should show error message)
   - [ ] Test dragging athlete who already cancelled (should prevent)

## Next Steps

With this critical page complete, the next priorities are:

1. **Athlete Schedule Page** (2-3 hours)
   - Update to show group names
   - Display exercises if available
   - Show if temporarily reassigned to different group

2. **Athlete Dashboard** (2-3 hours)
   - Show group name in "Next Session" card
   - Update training info display

3. **Remaining Trainer Pages** (4-6 hours)
   - Update other trainer views to work with groups
   - Session planning pages
   - Statistics pages

---

**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Ready for testing  
**Lines of Code**: ~1,000 (frontend + backend)  
**Time Invested**: ~8-10 hours estimated  
**Complexity**: HIGH (drag-and-drop, multiple APIs, complex state)  
**Impact**: CRITICAL (most-used page by trainers)
