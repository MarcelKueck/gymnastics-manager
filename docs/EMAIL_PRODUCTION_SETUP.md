# Email Production Setup Guide

## Prerequisites ‚úÖ

You've already completed:
- ‚úÖ Configured DNS records for `turnen.svesting.de` in Resend
- ‚úÖ Domain verification in Resend

## Step 1: Verify Domain Status in Resend

1. Log in to [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/domains)
2. Check that `turnen.svesting.de` shows as **"Verified"**
3. Note down the recommended sender email format (usually `noreply@turnen.svesting.de`)

## Step 2: Configure Environment Variables in Vercel

You need to add/update these environment variables in your Vercel project:

### Access Vercel Environment Variables

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com
2. Select your project (gymnastics-manager)
3. Click on **Settings** tab
4. Click on **Environment Variables** in the left sidebar

### Required Environment Variables

Add or update these variables:

| Variable Name | Value | Environment |
|--------------|-------|-------------|
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | `re_xxxxxxxxxxxxx` (your actual API key from Resend) | Production, Preview, Development |
| `EMAIL_FROM` | `noreply@turnen.svesting.de` | Production, Preview, Development |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | `https://turnen.svesting.de` (or your actual production URL) | Production |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | (leave as preview URL) | Preview |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | (your existing secret) | Already configured |
| `DATABASE_URL` | (your existing database URL) | Already configured |

### Important Notes:

- **RESEND_API_KEY**: Get this from [Resend Dashboard > API Keys](https://resend.com/api-keys)
- **EMAIL_FROM**: Must use your verified domain `turnen.svesting.de`
  - Recommended format: `noreply@turnen.svesting.de`
  - Alternative: `info@turnen.svesting.de` or `system@turnen.svesting.de`
- **NEXTAUTH_URL**: Must match your actual production domain

## Step 3: Redeploy Your Application

After setting the environment variables:

1. Go to **Deployments** tab in Vercel
2. Click on the latest deployment
3. Click the **‚ãÆ** (three dots) menu
4. Click **Redeploy**
5. Check **"Use existing Build Cache"** (faster)
6. Click **Redeploy**

OR simply push a new commit to trigger automatic deployment:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Configure production email settings"
git push
```

## Step 4: Test Email Functionality in Production

### Test 1: Use Test Email Page

1. Log in as trainer on production: `https://turnen.svesting.de/login`
2. Navigate to: `https://turnen.svesting.de/trainer/test-email`
3. Enter your email address
4. Test all 4 email types
5. Verify emails arrive in your inbox

### Test 2: Test Athlete Approval Flow

1. Register a new test athlete
2. Approve and configure the athlete as trainer
3. Check the athlete's email for approval notification

### Test 3: Monitor Email Sending

1. Check Vercel logs: **Deployments > [Latest] > Runtime Logs**
2. Look for email sending logs:
   - ‚úÖ Success: `"‚úÖ Approval email sent:"`
   - ‚ùå Errors: `"‚ùå Error sending approval email:"`

## Step 5: Verify Email Deliverability

### Check Resend Dashboard

1. Go to [Resend Dashboard > Emails](https://resend.com/emails)
2. You should see sent emails with their status:
   - ‚úÖ **Delivered**: Email successfully sent
   - üì¨ **Queued**: Email is being processed
   - ‚ùå **Bounced**: Email address invalid
   - üö´ **Complained**: Marked as spam

### Check Spam Score

1. Send a test email to yourself
2. Check if it lands in inbox or spam folder
3. If in spam:
   - Verify all DNS records are correct in Resend
   - Check SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records
   - Wait 24-48 hours for DNS propagation

## Step 6: Production Email Testing Checklist

Use this checklist to verify all email types work correctly:

- [ ] **Athlete Approval Email**
  - Register new athlete
  - Approve as trainer
  - Verify email received with correct training config

- [ ] **Schedule Change Email**
  - Edit athlete's training configuration
  - Verify email received with old vs new schedule

## Troubleshooting

2. Redeploy the application
3. Verify the key is correct in Resend dashboard

### Error: "Invalid sender email"
