# Dual Trainer Feature Implementation

## Overview
This feature allows each training session to have 1 or 2 trainers (Übungsleiter) assigned, replacing the previous single-trainer limitation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema
The existing `TrainerSessionAssignment` model already supported multiple trainers through a many-to-many relationship. No schema changes were required.

### 2. Backend API (`src/app/api/trainer/sessions/[date]/route.ts`)

#### GET Endpoint
- No changes needed - already returns all `trainerAssignments` as an array

#### PUT Endpoint
- **Changed**: Accepts `trainerIds` array instead of single `trainerId`
- **Validation**: Ensures 1-2 trainers per session (filters out empty values, limits to 2)
- **Logic**: 
  - Removes all existing trainer assignments for the session
  - Creates new assignments for each valid trainer ID
  - Prevents duplicate trainer assignments (same trainer can't be assigned twice to same session)

### 3. Frontend UI (`src/app/trainer/sessions/[date]/page.tsx`)

#### State Management
- **Changed**: `trainerAssignments` from `Record<string, string>` to `Record<string, string[]>`
- Stores array of trainer IDs per session (max 2)

#### UI Components
Added two dropdowns per session:
1. **Übungsleiter 1 (Pflicht)** - Required first trainer
   - Must be selected to enable second trainer dropdown
   - Disabled options: trainer already selected as second trainer

2. **Übungsleiter 2 (Optional)** - Optional second trainer
   - Only enabled when first trainer is selected
   - Disabled options: trainer already selected as first trainer
   - Can be cleared without affecting first trainer

#### Save Logic
- Sends `trainerIds` array in update payload
- Automatically filters out empty values on backend

### 4. Test Data (`prisma/seed.ts`)
- Added third trainer: Lisa Becker (trainer2@gym.com / trainer2)
- Makes testing dual trainer feature easier

## Business Rules

1. **Minimum**: Each session must have at least 1 trainer assigned (though the system allows 0 for backwards compatibility)
2. **Maximum**: Each session can have at most 2 trainers assigned
3. **Uniqueness**: The same trainer cannot be assigned twice to the same session
4. **Flexibility**: Second trainer can be added/removed independently as long as first trainer exists

## Testing

### Test Accounts
- Trainer 1: `trainer@gym.com` / `trainer123` (Max Müller)
- Trainer 2: `trainer2@gym.com` / `trainer2` (Lisa Becker)
- Admin: `admin@gym.com` / `admin123` (Anna Schmidt)

### Test Scenarios
1. **Single Trainer**: Select only first trainer, leave second empty
2. **Two Trainers**: Select both first and second trainers
3. **Change Trainers**: Update existing assignments
4. **Remove Second**: Clear second trainer while keeping first
5. **Validation**: Try to select second before first (should be disabled)
6. **Duplicate Prevention**: Try to select same trainer twice (should be disabled)

## UI/UX Features

- Clear labels indicating "Übungsleiter 1 (Pflicht)" and "Übungsleiter 2 (Optional)"
- Second dropdown is disabled until first trainer is selected
- Visual feedback preventing duplicate selections
- Maintains existing trainer assignments when loading session
- Seamlessly saves both trainers in single save operation

## Files Modified

1. `/home/marcel/gymnastics-manager/src/app/api/trainer/sessions/[date]/route.ts`
2. `/home/marcel/gymnastics-manager/src/app/trainer/sessions/[date]/page.tsx`
3. `/home/marcel/gymnastics-manager/prisma/seed.ts`

## Migration Notes

- **No database migration required** - existing schema already supports this
- **Backwards compatible** - existing single trainer assignments will display as first trainer
- **No data loss** - all existing trainer assignments are preserved

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. Add validation message if trying to save without any trainers
2. Display assigned trainers in session list view
3. Add trainer names to session summaries
4. Allow filtering sessions by assigned trainer
5. Add statistics showing trainer workload distribution
