the admin should easily be able to see the athletes that have 3 unexcused misses on one page and should be able to either reset their misses or be able to remove them entirely from the system with the click of one button which will handle everything and also send an automatic email to the athlete. Finally the admin should of course be able to add or remove athletes and trainers completely from their admin account.
