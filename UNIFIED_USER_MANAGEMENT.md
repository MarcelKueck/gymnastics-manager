# Unified User Management System - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Successfully merged all athlete and trainer management functionality into a single, comprehensive "Benutzer verwalten" (User Management) page. This provides a clean, centralized interface for managing all users in the system.

## Structural Changes

### Before (Separate Pages):
```
/trainer/athletes          → Trainer: Approve pending athletes
/trainer/admin/athletes    → Admin: Manage all athletes

```

### After (Unified):
```
/trainer/athletes          → Trainer: Approve pending athletes (kept for regular trainers)
/trainer/admin/users       → Admin: Manage ALL users (athletes + trainers + pending)
```
